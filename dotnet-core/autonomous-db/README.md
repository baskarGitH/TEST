This ODP.NET Core Autonomous DB code sample is intended to be used with the [Developing .NET Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/tech-info/default-5032178.html). 

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Oracle Autonomous Database, Including Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and 
Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Create a new .NET Core console project, add ODP.NET Core assembly ([Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Core/)) from NuGet Gallery, and paste the sample code. You can then enter your ADB connection and configuration information into the pasted sample code as described in the comments.

There are three samples, one each for ODP.NET Core, managed ODP.NET, and unmanaged ODP.NET. This directory contains the 
ODP.NET Core sample. The other ODP.NET Autonomous DB samples are located [here](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/samples/autonomous-db).
